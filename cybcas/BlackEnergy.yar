/*
We can focus on its known characteristics and behaviors as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK profile and other public threat intelligence sources. BlackEnergy has been associated with various activities, including DDoS attacks, espionage, and destructive actions. Key traits include the use of specific plugins, C2 communication patterns, and strings indicative of its functionality.
Key Components of the Rule
Plugin Detection: BlackEnergy's modular design includes plugins (e.g., msdsc.dat, ntfs.dat) for specific functionalities. These are explicitly included.
C2 Communication: The rule includes placeholders for domains and IPs used for C2 communication. Replace these with current indicators of compromise (IOCs).
API Calls: Detects key API functions BlackEnergy uses for process injection, memory manipulation, and loading malicious libraries.
Mutex and Registry Artifacts: Known mutex names and registry paths for persistence are included to catch static and behavioral indicators.
File Paths: Detects suspicious file placements in sensitive directories.

Customization and Validation
Update C2 IOCs: Replace placeholder C2 domains and IPs with real ones from your threat intelligence sources.
Adjust for False Positives: If legitimate applications in your environment use similar API calls or file paths, refine the rule to avoid false positives.
Test the Rule: Use BlackEnergy samples in a controlled environment or malware sandbox to validate the ruleâ€™s effectiveness and accuracy.
